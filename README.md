# Into

This project is a collection of small projects each of which is tackling some problem/technology using java as primary language.
These projects are independent with only 1 reason - make each one smaller. 
Some projects may require specific dependencies and this way each task will keep only necessary dependencies.

Every project is expected to have its own readme file so consider this one like an index.

* [dsa](./dsa/README.md) - java implementation of some common data structures and algorithms
* [design patterns](./designpatterns/README.md) - examples of the most common design patterns written in java
* [other](./other/README.md) - everything that is too small for a separate project but might be interesting
