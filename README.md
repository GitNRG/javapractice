# Into

This project contains implementations in java for a bunch of standard problems.
They are grouped into 3 categories
* Data Structures and Algorithms - sorting, searching, graphs etc
* Design Patterns - singleton, adapter, bridge, observer etc
* Other - everything that doesn't fit

See list below of what is ready and what is planned.

Most implementation go with a test suite, you can try implementing algorithm yourself 
and validate your implementation by injecting into corresponding it into a corresponding test class.


# Data Structures and Algorithms
